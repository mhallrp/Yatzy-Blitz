ðŸŽ² A basic Yatzy game with local or online multiplayer functionality via the apple gamecenter API but also single player with a virtual auto play opponent.

I esssentially built this simple game to experiment with the modern SwiftUI framework, it's on the apple App store so head over there if you want to give it a go: https://apps.apple.com/app/yatzy-blitz/id6462281925
